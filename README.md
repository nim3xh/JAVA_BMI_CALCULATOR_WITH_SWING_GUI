This is a Java application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using a Swing GUI. It allows users to input their weight and height, and then displays the calculated BMI along with a corresponding BMI category.

## Features

- User-friendly Swing GUI for easy input and interaction.
- Calculates BMI based on weight and height inputs.
- Displays the calculated BMI value and corresponding BMI category.
- Supports both metric (kilograms and meters) and imperial (pounds and inches) units.

1. Enter your weight in the provided input field. Make sure to select the appropriate unit (kilograms or pounds).

2. Enter your height in the provided input field. Make sure to select the appropriate unit (meters or inches).

3. Click the "Submit" button to calculate your BMI.

4. The calculated BMI value will be displayed, along with the corresponding BMI category (e.g., Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese).
